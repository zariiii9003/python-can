The contribution process has been improved and clarified for all contributors. The documentation now provides a clear, step-by-step guide for setting up a development environment, running tests with tox, and submitting changes. A new towncrier-based changelog system is introduced: contributors now add a small news fragment for each change, making release notes more accurate and automated. The CI and tox setup is streamlined, and a pull request template helps ensure all contributions follow best practices. These changes make it easier and more transparent for anyone to contribute to python-can.
