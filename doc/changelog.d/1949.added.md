The new public functions `can.cli.add_bus_arguments` and `can.cli.create_bus_from_namespace`
make it much easier to add python-can bus configuration options to your own command-line tools
and to create a bus instance from parsed arguments. This allows downstream packages and users
to support all standard python-can CLI options (such as channel, interface, bitrate, CAN-FD, filters,
and more) with minimal effort and consistent behavior.

Note: Previously, any unknown CLI arguments were automatically passed as keyword arguments to the bus.
Now, you must explicitly use the `--bus-kwargs` argument to pass extra options to the bus constructor.
